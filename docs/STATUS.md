# Status

All 8 build steps are done. This lists what each step shipped, and — separately — what's explicitly
not built yet.

## Built

- **Step 1 — Foundation.** Django + DRF backend, Expo + expo-router + react-native-web frontend, one
  health endpoint, one screen that proves the frontend can reach it.
- **Step 2 — Design system.** Colour/spacing/radius/type tokens (`mobile/src/theme/tokens.ts`), the
  component kit (`Button`, `TextField`, `Banner`, `Card`, `Toggle`, `Checkbox`, `Screen`, etc.), bundled
  Poppins/Nunito Sans fonts, the `/dev/kit` screen.
- **Step 3 — Accounts.** Signup, login, logout, access/refresh token auth, the `User` model, rate
  limiting on auth endpoints.
- **Step 4 — Business setup, steps 1–2.** Create a business (name, city, type), brand colour with a
  contrast-safe preview, logo upload.
- **Step 5 — Business setup, steps 3–4.** Starter stock items + custom stock items (step 3), starter
  sell items + custom sell items linked to stock (step 4), bulk save with per-row validation errors.
- **Step 6 — Business setup, step 5 (team).** Add team members (Manager/Helper) by mobile number, PIN
  login for team members, role-based access (403/404 on endpoints a role shouldn't reach).
- **Step 7 — Business setup, step 6 (alerts) and completion.** Wastage/price-rise alert thresholds,
  "Use recommended settings", `/setup/done` and `/home` summaries, resuming a skipped wizard step.
- **Step 8 — Installable app shell (PWA) and offline message.** Web manifest + generated icons (192,
  512, maskable 512, apple-touch-icon), a hand-written service worker that caches the app shell and
  bundled fonts (never the API, auth, or uploaded media), an update-available banner with no forced
  reload, an offline hook + persistent offline banner, every write blocked while offline with no
  request sent, the auth bootstrap check treating "offline" as distinct from "signed out" (stored
  tokens are kept), safe-area padding, a friendly 404 screen, a production build
  (`npm run build:web` / `npm run serve:web`) and an automated `npm run pwa-check`.

## Not built yet

- **OTP provider** — signup/login use a password/PIN only; no SMS OTP integration.
- **Forgot password** — no reset flow of any kind.
- **PIN change and forced password change** — a team member's PIN and an owner's password can be set
  once (signup, add-team) but never changed afterwards; no forced-change-on-first-login flow.
- **Account screen** — no screen to change your own password, or to request account deletion.
- **Logo delete** — a business logo can be uploaded and replaced, but not removed back to no logo.
- **Per-process rate limiting across multiple workers** — the current rate limiter is in-process memory;
  it needs a shared cache (e.g. Redis) before running behind more than one worker process.
- **Privacy / terms URLs** — the signup consent checkbox links to placeholder text, not real pages.
- **A legacy/ code reuse plan** — `legacy/` (the earlier multi-tenant restaurant SaaS build) is kept
  intact and untouched; nothing in the current app reads from or depends on it, and no decision has
  been made about reusing any of its code. Do not delete it.
- **Stock, sales and costing features** — the setup wizard records starter/custom stock and sell items,
  but there is no screen yet to record daily purchases, sales, wastage, or to see costing/margin
  reports. That's the next phase of the product, not part of these 8 steps.
